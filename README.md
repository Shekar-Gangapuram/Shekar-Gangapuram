## Features

- Real-time traffic sign recognition
- Distance estimation based on size and focal length
- Easy integration with existing projects
- Supports various traffic sign datasets

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic_sign_recognition_and_distance_estimation.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd traffic_sign_recognition_and_distance_estimation
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python traffic_sign_recognition_and_distance_estimation.py --input <path_to_image>
```

### Parameters

- `--input`: Path to the input image containing traffic signs.
- `--output`: (Optional) Path to save the output image with annotations.
- `--model`: (Optional) Specify the model to use for recognition (default: 'model.h5').

## Examples

To recognize traffic signs and estimate their distance from an image:

```bash
python traffic_sign_recognition_and_distance_estimation.py --input example.jpg --output output.jpg
```

This will process `example.jpg` and save the annotated image as `output.jpg`.
